										<p>In taking a page from academia, we believe that a sound investment philosophy should begin by making certain assumptions or postulates about the market, and then seek to derive logical conclusions that follow these assumptions.</p>
										<p>In describing the Cambiar philosophy, we begin with the primary observation that the capital markets are relatively efficient over the long term, but prone to bouts of myopia and excess over shorter-term time periods. The greater the volatility of perception within a given sector, the wider the dispersion of returns, and the more opportunity for an active manager such as Cambiar to add value.</p>
										<p>Stocks may be mispriced for a variety of reasons—low investor interest, excessive negative sentiment towards the sector, or the incorrect differentiation between transitory vs. terminal headwinds facing the company. The key focal point for Cambiar is to understand why a company stock price is lagging, but more importantly, <strong>is there an underlying inflection point in the business that will enable the stock price to be revalued upwards?</strong></p>

										<p>While price sensitivity at the point of purchase can provide a good backstop, Cambiar also recognizes the opportunity cost of allocating capital to a stock that does not have a notable catalyst over a forward 1-2 year timeframe.</p>
										<p>The Cambiar philosophy seeks to identify valuation disconnects in the marketplace; where companies are trading at an attractive valuation relative to their normalized earnings power. Despite an increasing trend towards passive management and inferred belief in efficient markets, Cambiar continues to believe that stocks do incur dislocations; the key is to understanding the cause for the disconnect and if the issues are due to transitory events or more secular in nature.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="column-item">
										<p>Cambiar attempts to add value through active management—we believe that one must look different than the index in order to outperform. All portfolio decisions are based on our in-house research approach; the Cambiar investment team is focused on understanding where value is eroding and accreting within their assigned sectors, with the goal to allocate capital to the latter. This bottom-up approach will often result in sector and individual holdings that differ from the underlying index.</p>

											<p>Cambiar investment principals seek companies that are <strong>best-of-breed</strong> within their sector or industry, and have some defensible characteristics—i.e. patents, established infrastructure (patents), switching costs, etc. Cambiar also looks for high quality in the way of strong financials—balance sheet strength, low debt/equity levels, and demonstrable free cash flow over a full market cycle. Finally, Cambiar companies should be led by a competent management team that has a constructive relationship with their public shareholders.</p>

											<p>The Cambiar investment team uses <strong>conventional financial measures,</strong> such as Price/Earnings, Price/Book Value, etc to track businesses. An underlying premise of the Cambiar philosophy is that certain industries tend to follow certain valuation ranges; the market does not randomly value stocks. Our preference is for companies to be trading at the lower end of their normalized valuation range at the point of purchase. Given the underlying mean reversion element, it is critical for the analysts to be confident that the fundamentals/industry dynamics that resulted in historical valuation ranges are consistent going forward. Given our more conservative investment stance, Cambiar tends to be highly skeptical of ‘new paradigm’ industry valuations.</p>

											<p>Another component of the investment process is to identify some type of <strong>fundamental positive development</strong> that can change the market’s current negative perception of the company. Such catalysts may come in varying forms; examples include: new product introductions, managerial changes, divestiture of an underperforming division, or simply better financial performance. Valuation in and of itself is not a catalyst—there must be some identifiable event that will cause investors to reassess the business and award it a higher valuation.</p>

											<p>The final component is the company’s <strong>upside potential</strong>: all new purchases must demonstrate the ability to achieve Cambiar’s high hurdle rate over a 12-24 month time horizon. The results are diversified, benchmark-agnostic portfolios designed to outperform their respective benchmarks.</p>
											<p class="text-small">50% upside target is created by Cambiar and can be achieved through a variety of contributing factors—including multiple expansion, earnings growth and dividend yield.  Cambiar's objective of selecting stocks having a potential for 50% appreciation may or may not be realized.</p>
